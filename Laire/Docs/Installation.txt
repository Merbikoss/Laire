	Designed for Laire Alpha 1.1 and later

	----- INSTALLATION -----

 1 - Make sure that you have a UNIX-like operating system.

 2 - Make sure that you have Java 23 or newer, and you set
 your JAVA_HOME variables correctly.

 3 - Make sure you didn't install Java with a package
 manager. Follow the JAVA CONFIGURATION manual.

	----- JAVA CONFIGURATION -----

 (WARNING: Everything said here is about UNIX-like operating systems.
 DO NOT TRY WITH WINDOWS!)

 Install JDK 23 or higher from Adoptium or Oracle as tar.gz
 binaries. Go to the home directory, and create a folder
 called "JavaHome" or something similar that is about Java Home.
 Then, extract the binary into this directory. Copy the
 location of the folder and create a variable called JAVA_HOME.
 Paste this into your shell configuration file:
 JAVA_HOME="(ENTER LOCATION HERE)"
 PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
 Now we added the Java Home path to the system variables.
 Test your new Java with running java --version.
 If it doesn't work, you can remove the given code from
 your shell configuration and try using the package manager
 Java instead.

 So, it looks like you've already extracted the Laire archive
 file. Laire is only packaged as source form, because of the
 cross-platform nature of Java, the language that Laire was
 written on.

 TLDR, you need to compile it. You can compile Laire by run-
 ning the compile.sh shell script. Trust me, it only takes
 maximum 1 second, also it starts Laire at the same time.
 
 And? Nothing. Your setup is probably complete (except the
 Laire session setup) Enjoy your new Laire session!
